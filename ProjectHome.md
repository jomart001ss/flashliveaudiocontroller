## What? ##

Flash Live Audio Controller is an Flash Actionscript 3 project with a practical, reusable, solution for creating projects that need to be controlled with live audio.

## Why? ##

We wanted to make (multiplayer) flash games which could be controlled by your own voice. We first thought this would be very simple, since flash CS3 allow1 you to do a fft analysis on audio sources. However, this computeSpectrum function does not work on the microphone input (what a shame!). Therefore we created this project.

## What we used ##

For this project we used:
  * [ASAP library](http://code.google.com/p/asaplibrary/)
  * [Flosc](http://benchun.net/flosc/)
  * [MaxMsp](http://www.cycling74.com/) (not for free)
